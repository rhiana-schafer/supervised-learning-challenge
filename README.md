# supervised-learning-challenge

In this repo, I present code on building a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. The code contains both a logistic regression model, and a random forests classifier. 

# Model performance prediction
Before I begin, I predict that based on what we have discussed in class, the random forest classifier model will perform better. Generally, a random forest model performs better as it reduces the risk of overfitting, especially when working on datasets with high numbers of features. However as this dataset has <10 features, this is less of a concern, so perhaps the models will not be significantly that different. How much of a difference it makes will probably depend on whether collinearity is present in the data, as well as the level of randomness.
